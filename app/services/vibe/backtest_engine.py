"""Simplified event-driven backtest engine for vibe trading signals.

The engine walks a historical OHLCV DataFrame and simulates trades based on a
fixed direction, entry price, stop loss and target price. It is intentionally
simplified: it does not model slippage, fees, partial fills, position sizing,
or time-in-force.
